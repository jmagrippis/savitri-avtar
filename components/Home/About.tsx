              <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                I am an International KRI certified Kundalini Yoga teacher and a
                licensed IKYTA Teacher for Children. My passion for yoga started
                in 2010 when I first practiced Sivananda Yoga. Several years
                later I discovered <strong>Kundalini Yoga</strong> and
                immediately experienced how its techniques impacted positively
                all aspects of my life.

              <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                The transformation was so significant that I decided to take the
                Level 1 teacher training at the Sahej Academy and later, in
                order to deepen my knowledge of yoga and meditation, enrolled
                into Level 2: the advanced training for Kundalini Yoga teachers.
                I was blessed to train with some of the best teachers in the UK
                and direct students of <strong>Yogi Bhajan</strong>, the Master
                of Kundalini Yoga from India.

                For the last four years yoga, both teaching and practicing, has
                been an integral part of my life, and I am very grateful that I
                can share this wonderful technology with you.

                Amongst my other passions are teaching yoga to children, the
                practice of Numerology (a system for revealing oneâ€™s strengths
                and challenges that can show the true path), and playing the
                Gong.
